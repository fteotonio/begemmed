# begemmed

**begemmed** was made as a C++ and SDL 2.0 exercise to provide as a code example in job interviews. It is an implementation of a classic tile-matching game in which tiles can be switched adjacently to combine 3 tiles of the same color. It features difficulty scaling over time, combo scoring, and a clean minimalistic user interface.
